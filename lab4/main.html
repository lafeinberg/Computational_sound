  <h2>Part 1: Live Coding Langugage</h2>
  <p>This is an almost minimal command-based live coding engine. Press the button to re-evaluate your code.
    This language allows you to specify a rhythmic pattern of beats by entering a comma and space-separated list of times and pitches. 
    You can also include javascript computation in the values.
    As an example:
  </p>
  <p>1+1@220, 2@220*2, 1*3@270</p>

  <p>My additional feature allows you to specify repeated patterns within the language. The following changes were made to the existing langauge:  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Comma: instead of just a space separating the notes, we now have commas that separate the main sections of notes</li>
    <li>Brackets: allow for the user to define a repeated pattern of notes. The value before the brackets defines how many times the pattern repeats, inside the brackets defines the pattern.</li>
    <li>NOTE: You cannot have nested brackets (ex. 1+1@220, 3[2@220*2 4[1*3@270]])</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You CANNOT have nested brackets (ex. 1+1@220, 3[2@220*2 4[1*3@270]])</li>
    <li>You do not include commas within the bracketed region (ex. "1@220, 5@300" --> yes comma. "3[1@220 5@300]" --> no comma) </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Example usage: (e.g. "3@340, 2[1@220 2@330]" plays as "3@340, 1@220, 2@330, 1@220, 2@330")</p>
