  <div class="text-container"><p>According to Andy Farnell, fire is an “oxidation reaction that has gone out of control”, and it is an exothermic reaction between the air, containing oxygen, and fuel. The main components of fire are: liquefaction and boiling, outgassing, explosion, stress, disintegration, flames. These manifest in sounds: lapping, cracking, hissing, bubbling, creaking, fizzing, roaring, whining, popping clattering. We will focus on the first thing. 
    Fire sound has 3 categories that are “summed” or added together to make the sound: lapping, hissing, and crackling. Lapping is the flame sound, hissing is the pressure generated by the firing, and crackling are the pops heard of popping wood at a fireplace. </p></div>

  <h3>Crackling</h3>
  <div class="text-container"><p>Cracking is executed by looping white noise sound through gain, and connecting them to the audio destination. The cracks must occur at "random" times and should be a popping sound, similar to a click. These should occur at "random" increments. This is done by using white noise with a noise buffer and allowing for a sharp noise to "spurt". The loundness of these pops are controlled by gain nodes, PER white noise buffer, which in set randomly to set a more randomized cracking sound.</p></div>
  <img src="CRACKLING.JPG" alt="Description of the image" width="600">
  <div class="text-container"><p>The cracking sound, is done with setting the intervals in total 5-7 times, which calls the createCrack() function. Thus, these are called conseculativly until the stop button is pressed.</p></div>

  <div class="text-container"><p>Please follow the annotated notes for decisions for parameters, and the process for defining a crack.</p></div>

  <h3>Lapping</h3>
  <div class="text-container"><p>Lapping is the sound of the flames and the reaction as a the fuel reacts with the air. It is the waning sound of the fire. This is done by using a combination of bandpass, highpass, and curve clipping. </p></div>
  <img src="LAPPING.JPG" alt="Description of the image" width="600">
  <div class="text-container"><p>Process of generation: the bandpass filter allows frequencies around 50 Hz to pass through while attenuating frequencies outside this range. Flames produce a characteristic low-frequency rumble, and this filter emphasizes those frequencies. The highpass filters help cut off the high frequencies of the audio which "clean" it. The highpass filters allows for the rumbles and cuts out a low "wave-like" sound that should not be present in the fire. The wave shaper introduces distortion to the audio waveform. The specified distortion curve alters the shape of the sound wave, simulating the fluctations of the flames. The 0 paramater was chosen to get rid of a constant buzzing sound, HOWEVER, this causes a click in the beginning of the audio when the "play" button is pressed for the first time. I am not sure how to get rid of this. The gain node is used to modulate the intensity of the flame noise sound, which makes it a "background" sound of the code. The sound is underlied by white noise, which, when passed through the said filters and compoents, generates the fluctuating rumbling sound. </p></div>

  <h3>Hissing</h3>
  <div class="text-container"><p>The hissing sound is generated when the flame reacts with the air and releases pressure. This creates SPURTS of hissing.</p></div>
  <img src="HISSING.JPG" alt="Description of the image" width="600">
  <div class="text-container"><p>The audio processing chain starts with the generation of two white noise source, one passed through a high-pass filter, and one passed through low-pass. These help create the hissing sound by emphasizing frequencies above and below a certain Hz, creaitng a sharper sound. Given this baseline hiss, we must use oscillators to create a more "random" fizzing sound that is not constant. I chose sine wave and sawtooth to create a more varied, less "wave-like" oscillation of the hissing. This gives a more realistic effect. Additionally, we then pass these values through gains, which varies how loud the hissing is percieved. The gains are used to modulate the interaction between the white noise and the oscillators, to overall create a "sporadic" hiss. I made the frequencies low, and tried to lower the gains as well to allow for a very subtle hissing sound.</p></div>
